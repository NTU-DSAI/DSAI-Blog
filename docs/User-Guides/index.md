This section aims to help future students understand how to use key NTU infrastructure and apps to reduce friction as a freshman.

:::note

NTU has a variety of systems and we will attempt to cover the important ones. If there is something that we have missed out and you feel that it should be here, do contribute at the repository [here](http://www.github.com/NTU-DSAI/NTU-DSAI.github.io).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
```
