## Introduction

If you are someone that is looking for a [FYP](../Module-Review/Y4S1/SC4079%20Final%20Year%20Project.md) but the ones offered by the school do not interest you, this might be the programme for you. This programme allows you to do your FYP project at company so that you can get hands on experience with real world problems and use your knowledge to solve them.

## Requirements

There are a few requirements that you need to meet before the school approves your project with the external company.

### Approval of Academic Chair and FYP IC

You will also need the exlicit permission of the current Academic Chair as well as the Prof-in-Charge of Final Year projects to undertake ISFYP. Please seek this permission first before you proceed with the following steps

### Finding a Company

Firstly you have to find a Company that is willing to work with you. There is no NTU portal where you can surf potential companies for a partnership. Ideally, this company is one that you have worked with before during a previous Summer/Winter internship and they are familiar with your work style and you are familiar with their business and technical challenges. This is especially important as the company has to pay the school a **one time administrative fee of $10,000** for access to the school's resources. Make sure you have built a good enough relationship with the company and your project is one that is worthwhile that justifies them paying that sum.

### Finding a Prof

A SCSE professor has to register the project on the StaffLink portal and supervise you for the full duration of your project. You will have to reach out to multiple professors and find one that is willing to supervise you. Ideally, try to look for a professor that has research/subject matter experience in the field that you are pursuing so that they can guide you properly.

## Application Process

1. Email the Prof-in-Charge for a copy of the ISFYP agreement.
2. Fill out agreement form and get signatures from your Company's representative (HR or your supervisor), your NTU supervisor and yourself
3. Email the completed agreement to the Prof-in-Charge, and make sure to CC all relevant parties.

## Benefits

The biggest benefits to the programme are:

1. You will be doing something that interests you as you can discuss with the company in advance and choose your project as compared to the regular FYP where it is allocated to you.
2. Your projet can be more application based rather than research intensive so you will learn more practical skills that you can use in the future.
3. If you perform well and the company is satisfied with you, you can be offered a full time opportunity upon graduation.
