description: General overview of MPEs

Major Prescribed Electives (MPEs) are modules that pertain directly to the degree that the student is persuing. Unlike Core modules, students have a choice as to which MPEs they want to take in order to graduate. For DSAI students, MPEs are split between 3 SCSE and 3 SPMS modules. As a rule of thumb, MPEs should be taken as per your interests and what you want to achieve in your career.
