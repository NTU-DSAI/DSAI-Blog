## Course Summary

This course covers a number of topics in network science and its applications. The specific topics include network metrics, properties, and models, network querying and analytics, network dynamics, and distributed graph engines. Some example content are as follows.

- Different types of network models and corresponding properties
- Not limited to the following, Graph Mining, Matching, Partitioning, Coarsening

## Workload

Workload is fairly heavy for most of the semester, with two quizzes; this mod is both theory and project heavy. However, some tutorial questions will be reused in finals word for word, if not slightly different.

## Projects

There are two projects for this mod, first is mainly generating networks and computing some metrics. Second project is doing literature review of scientific papers on networks, replicating results and providing constructive criticisim.

## Things to take note of

Note that this mod very much depends on networkx (python package) to generate and manipulate networks. Do spend some time familiarizing with this package before your decision.

## Conclusion

Should you not find interest in the aforementioned topics and/or package, I would not recommend this module. Otherwise, this module is excellent for providing a basic understanding of networks.
