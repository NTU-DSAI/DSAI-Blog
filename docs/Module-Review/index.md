This section aims to help future students understand what they can expect from modules based on the experiences of their seniors.

:::note

The following list of modules is based on the latest [Curriculum Structure](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/curriculum-structure#Content_C021_Col00) and we will attempt to update this as the curriculum evolves.

:::

:::caution

The views expressed herein are entirely of the various students that have undertaken the modules. We will attempt to be as neutral and objective as possible but your experience may vary.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
```

:::note

This list only goes up till Y4S1 as the second semester consists of only FYP (covered in Y4S1) and MPEs (covered in the MPE section).
