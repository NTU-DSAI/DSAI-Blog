## Course Summary

This course aims to look at moral and ethical issues surrounding the use of AI in the modern world. The course is more focussed on the current law surrounding the use of technology in the US and Singapore and how that can affect everyday citizens. The course is taught by Prof Mark Cenite, who really makes the whole experience of learning the subject very interesting.

## Workload

This is a lecture only subject with a few tests during lecture time and hence it is a really great module if you are looking for something that won't take too much time away from your schedule. There is a 10 min quiz at the start of each lecture and you must pass at least 5 of them to have your grades count.

## Things to take note of

1. The prof always passes around a mic in the LT and asks students for their input on the subject matter so do remember to pay attention.
2. The content covered in the lectures has to be some of the most interesting content that you will learn at NTU. It helps that you are a DSAI student and this will be directly relevant to you in the future.
3. This is primarily a law related course and hence technical knowhow is not required. Only that you can reason out the scenarios presented logically and arrive at a conclusion.

## Conclusion

This module is definitely worth taking as it is engaging, fun and relevant to DSAI students.
