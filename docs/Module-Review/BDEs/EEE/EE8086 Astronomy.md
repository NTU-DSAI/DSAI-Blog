## Course Summary

The basic goal of this course is to give you a fundamental understanding of astronomy. Through the course, you will learn about the birth and evolution of the universe, the origin of galaxies, the evolution of stars and the formation of planets. Our solar system will also be one of the main topics to be studied. Important cosmology topics will be presented, some unanswered mysteries of the universe and mankind will be discussed and hopefully arise further interest and lead you to further your own exploration.

During this course, the diverse facts that form the context of a science will be delivered, and as a result you will understand our place in the Universe. You will also have opportunities to participate in various practical sessions: a few evening stargazing session are organized during the semester - where possible - in order to facilitate direct observation of suitable astronomical objects (Moon, planets, star clusters).

## Workload

This is a lecture only module and does not have any tutorial/homework. Hence it is a great way to get AUs without having to dedicate a lot of time each week.

## Things to take note of

1. This course is very content heavy and thus will require a lot of memorisation or interest in the subject matter to get a good grade.
2. This course is MCQ only and thus it is very achievable to get an A+, given that you have studied adequately.
3. The prof for the second half may be a bit difficult to understand given his accent, which only exacerbates the dryness of content that he is teaching.
4. The prof for the second half makes very "colourful" slides that might not be easy to follow along.

## Conclusion

Take this course at your own risk. It is quite a fun module if you are really interested in space and can memorise large amounts of content.
