Broadening and Deepening Electives (BDEs) and Unrestricted Electives (UEs) are courses taken by students that are outside their current field to give the student a wholistic education. These can also be taken by the student if they choose to study courses that are MPEs of courses other than their own in the same school.

The latest curriculum requires students to take 21 AUs of BDEs at a minimum and students can choose to excceed this number if they so desire. Do note that Programmes like the Work Study Programme will convert some of the BDE/UEs into Core AUs if so required by the programme, thus giving the student more freedom in planning their modules.
