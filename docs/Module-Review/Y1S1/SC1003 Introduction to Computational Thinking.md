## Course Summary

This module is an introductory module for computer science students, covering basic idea of computing and an introduction to Python. The course content is as follows:

1. Programming Languages
2. Basic Internal Operations of Computers
3. Basic Program Structure
4. Abstraction
5. Decomposition
6. Pattern Recognition
7. Algorithm Design and Complexity

## Workload

Workload is moderate, with weekly lectures and lab sessions.

## Projects

There is one graded Python coding project, which is completed in assigned groups. An example from previous years is to write a simple program that informs users of the availability and price of various menu items at a fictitious canteen.

## Things to take note of

No prior programming experience is assumed, so this is more or less the 'introduction to programming' course that NTU offers for DSAI students. It is very manageable to get by with ny programming experience, although it is a good idea to take the opportunity to learn as much as you can from peers who do have experience with coding.

## Conclusion

Important introductory module to computing and Python in general. This module provides a good foundation for students to begin their programming journey. However, it is a good idea to keep self learning and absorbing more from subsequent CS modules, as this module is very foundational.
