## Course Summary

Discrete math mainly involves dealing logical arguments, and using various rules to determine truth. Overall, this course gives students a good foundation for mathematical thinking and reasoning, which is useful background knowledge for the other math courses in the curriculum. The topics that are covered are:

1. Number Theory
2. Propositional Logic
3. Predicate Logic
4. Proof Techniques
5. Combinatorics
6. Linear Recurrence Theory
7. Set Theory
8. Relations
9. Functions
10. Graph Theory

## Workload

3AU module. Standard workload for an introductory math course, with weekly lectures and tutorials, midterms and a final exam. Generally not too hard to stay on track with this module by following the online LAMS.

## Projects

No project work.

## Things to take note of

One thing to note is that a lot of the content is taught using LAMS, which are online recorded lessons. There is a bit of a steep learning curve when it comes to familiarizing with mathematical notation, and just getting used to thinking in a mathematical/logical manner. Don't get discouraged if it is difficult, these things are actually very useful and we tend to get better with time. Also the final exams have historically been quite challenging, so it is good to practice with past papers.

## Conclusion

Quite a standard foundational math course.
