## Course Summary

This is a course that covers a good deal of concepts relating to calculus, from basics like limits and first principles, to concepts that are most likely new, like Taylor series approximations and big-o notation. The specific topics that are covered are:

1. Sets
2. Functions
3. Limits
4. Derivatives
5. Integrals
6. Differenital Equations
7. Series
8. Taylor Series
9. Power Series

## Workload

Workload is quite heavy. Being a 4AU course, there is naturally more content to cover, and for most students a lot of this content is likely either new or very rigorous. There are weekly lectures, tutorials, as well as midterms and a final exam.

## Projects

No projects.

## Things to take note of

The content covered in this course is quite challenging, and there is a lot of new mathematical notation and ideas that are introduced. Students are taught to think and prove mathematical ideas rigorously. This can be a challenging learning curve, but is also one that makes subsequent math modules (like [MH2100 Calculus 3](../Y3S1/MH2100%20Calculus%203.md)) more manageable.

## Conclusion

Tough module, but lectures are very good and well put together.
