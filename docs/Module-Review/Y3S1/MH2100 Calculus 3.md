## Course Summary

This course covers calculus in 3 dimensions and thus includes content on Vectors, Vector fields and Coordinate Change.
It is taught by Gary Greeves which is a student favourite professor as he is articulate and knowledgeable.
The content covered is:

1. Vectors
2. Limits
3. Continuity
4. Partial Derivatives
5. Tangent Planes
6. Differentiability
7. Linear Approximations
8. Directional Derivative
9. Gradient Vector
10. Critical Points
11. Lagrange Multipliers
12. Coordinate Change
13. Plane Transformation
14. Line Integrals
15. Surface Integrals
    1. Scalar Field
    2. Vector Field
16. Curl
17. Stoke's Theorem

## Workload

The workload is generally manageable but the lecutres might seem a bit content heavy.
Once understood they are pretty easy to just apply since it's just mathematics but it can get tedious.

## Projects

There are no projects for this as this is a pure mathematics module.
There are 2 graded assignments and some online quizzes throughout the module so do be prepared for that.

## Things to take note of

The prof uses an online tool to check your knowledge during the lectures and this counts towards an attendance mark so please do attend lectures for this.
It also helps to solidify your understanding of the content taught.

## Conclusion

A pretty challenging but necessary module to take, espeically as a ML student, as this is how stochastic gradient descent works and thus it is very important for your understanding.
