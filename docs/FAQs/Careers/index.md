### Can I find out what is the career path of a DSAI graduate?

The opportunities are limitless. This course is designed so you can be a data scientist, machine learning engineer or even a business intelligence developer. It is also envisioned that you can take up roles which require a masters degree in data science / AI, as this course offers an equivalent rigour. This course was in fact started from industrial demand. (Our profs told us that many companies are just waiting for us to graduate to have us in their companies!)

### What kind of job can you expect?

A very exciting job. Jobs involving data science are not only technical, but also requires creativity and domain expertise. Be prepared to continuously learning even after you graduated from this degree - you will always have to keep on learning in this industry. For this very reason, we have the [SkillsFuture Work-Study Degree](../../Programmes/WSDP.md) where you are attached to a company from Year 2 and do an industrial FYP. That gives a very good opportunity for you to be exposed to the industry.

Of course, if you decide not to do data science / AI-related jobs in the future, the foundational CS modules will also prepare you well for, say, software engineering / development related jobs, a more traditional CS route.

Again, as we are still a new course, we do not have statistics to back up all these. But be rest assured, we have seniors in CS who specialised in data science and AI who are doing very well in the industry. You will also get to understand the jobs in the industry better as we have industry affiliates coming to meet you all and offer internship opportunities.
