### What can we expect for the faculty camp?

For faculty camp, you can expect a few talks on administrative details, exchange etc., as well as some games with your orientation groups, and a beach day etc. You should use this as an oppurtunity to get to know people outside DSAI as well to add some variety to your life!

### Do you enjoy Hall life?

I think anyone that has stayed in Hall will tell you that it is the most fun time of your life. Of course this requires some effort on your part to make friends and attend events, join clubs and societies etc. Being a Hall Phantom (someone that just stays in Hall for the residence and doesn't participate) will not get you the experience that you deserve.

You do have to be prepared to spend quite some time with all of these activites as spending time socialising will come at the expense of your study time or your sleep (not recommended for health reasons but likely the first thing to be sacrificed). Thus, do take care to plan your time carefully and take care of your health at the same time.

Ultimately, your Uni life only comes once and it is the first time that most of us will venture out of the comforts of our own homes and live alone or with a roommate in a society of your peers. The friendships that you forge will last with you for a lifetime so do make the effort to make as many friends as possible and cherish the few that are the closest to you.

### Should I take a CCA?

Taking a CCA is encouraged if you want to make more friends from outside of your course and imperitive if you want to secure your place in your Hall of choice from Year 3 onwards (Hall is only guaranteed for the first 2 years in NTU). It is also recommended to have a leadership position as this increases the number of points that you have and thus your chances of getting a Hall.
