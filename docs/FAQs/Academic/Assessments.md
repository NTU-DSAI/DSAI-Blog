### Are there more projects and assignments or tests and examinations?

DSAI is a major combo of math and computer science mods. Most computer science mods are project based, while most math modules are examination based. So you will have an equal balance of project and exam based mods.

### Are exam papers available for practice online?

Past year papers for most modules are uploaded in the [NTU library](https://ts.ntu.edu.sg/sites/lib-repository/exam-question-papers) website which you can access after you matriculate and get your Network Account. The professors also usually give sample papers and answers for reference, so there won't be an issue :)

### How long is an examination?

It depends on the exam. Quizzes are around 30-90 mins, and examinations go from 1.5 to 3 hours depending on the course.

### Will the exams from different modules be on the same day?

Yes some of the modules have exams on the same day so just plan your schedule accordingly.

### Will exams take place at night?

The max timing an exam can have is till 7 pm not beyond that.

### Will there be some kind of open book or cheat sheet during exams?

Some courses allow a restricted open book where u will be asked to bring ur cheat sheet which would comprise of one A4 sheet and some mods allow complete open book where u can bring all your lecture notes and the textbook and additional materials.

### Do we use computers for exams?

For modules that require programming tests, usually these are done in lab tests before the finals exam period (e.g. [Data Structures](../../Module-Review/Y1S2/SC1007%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms.md)), on locked down school computers. Mostly the questions are given as a take-home assignment or such.

### Will we be in groups for all projects or are there some individual projects/assignments?

There is a good mixture of individual assignments and group projects. Some projects will have individual components as well.

### Are we graded on a bell curve?

Most projects do have bell curve or the grades will be standardised across cohort.

### Do we get the same grades as our group members for projects?

Regarding having the same grades as ur group members, usually the Prof/TA(teaching assistant) will ask about the workload split of the project and that's how they will guage if everyone in the group gets the same marks.

### What if I am unable to cope with my studies?

The professors do have consultation time slots which they will announce during the first lecture where you can go down to their office for any questions you may have. There are also peer tutoring sessions every week organised by the school. In DSAI, all the seniors are very helpful so do not be afraid to ask a senior for help!

### Do I get to choose my own groupmates?

It depends on the module but generally you can choose your groupmates.

### What are some examples of projects done by DSAI students?

Generally the projects follow the topics of the course. For [Intro to Data Science](../../Module-Review/Y1S2/SC1015%20Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science%20and%20AI.md), you will have to make prediction models on a given dataset of your choice while for [Software Engineering](../../Module-Review/Y2S1/SC2006%20Software%20Engineering.md), you will have to create a web/mobile app using a toolkit of your choosing. You can check out the projects repository [here](https://github.com/NTU-DSAI/DSAI-Projects) for a full list of projects done thus far.
