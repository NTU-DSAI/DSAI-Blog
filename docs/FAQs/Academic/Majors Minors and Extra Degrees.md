### Is it advisable to take two minors?

According to the compulsory credit requirements, you can take 5 Electives which can be used to complete a single minor. If you want to do a second minor, you will have to take up an extra 5 courses (around 15 credits). Taking these courses are up to you if you are ready to take up the extra pressure, since you will be doing almost one extra course every semester towards your minor. It is still a great addition, but you must also know that you will have extra workload that recommended. You also look at these FAQs on Minor Programmes [here](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/OAS2/minor/minor_FAQ.pdf).

### What minors complement DSAI?

If you want to do more in science and add on to DSAI, minoring in Math, Physics etc will be useful in my opinion. If you want to touch up other fields where you can think about implementing DSAI in the future, you can take a minor in business, entrepreneurship, economics etc.As DSAI is an interdisciplinary course, other fields may also be useful depending on your interest. A minor in linguistics may help if you are interested in natural language processing. A minor in econs helps you understand the data about the world. A minor in phy / chem / bio helps you apply DSAI for natural sciences.

:::note

DSAI students are not allowed to minor in computing or mathematics, for obvious reasons. You can look through the list of minor programmes by school and see if anything interests you.

### Can I take a Second Major with DSAI?

NTU has just launched a new Double Degree programme with DSAI. At this time we cannot comment on things like workload and courses as there are currently no students enrolled in these programmes. You can find more details on the programme [here](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/double-degree-in-accountancy-and-science).
