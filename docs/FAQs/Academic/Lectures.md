### Will the lecture notes be available online and we will have to pre-print them?

Yes. Almost all modules have lecture notes online which you can pre-printed but it's not a necessity (do save paper please). A few modules upload notes and slides on a weekly basis, and a few upload all at once, and you can print accordingly.

### Will lecturers give hints before exams?

It depends. Some give hints during the last lecture, but don't take it for granted as the hints tend to be vague! Keep an eye on those unrecorded or revision lectures.

### Are the lectures interesting and can the Profs teach well?

As always, there will be lecturers that may not be very engaging/interactive, but at the same time there are also some great professors that teach really well. At the end of the day, studying not just DSAI, but any undergraduate course in any university would require a fair amount of active learning on your part and taking your education into your own hands. For a lot of seniors, this has meant talking to Profs personally, studying together and just putting in extra time on our own.
