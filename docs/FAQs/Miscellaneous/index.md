### Is there alot of travelling between faculties?

Depends. Since we have a lot of both CS and Math courses, which are from 2 different schools at 2 different ends of the Spine, you might have to rush to your next class across school if your schedule is as such. Travelling from one place to the other for class by walk will not take you more than 10 mins, and there is also a buffer time between classes, and so you don't have to worry about it. Profs will also be understanding if you are late.

### Are there any medical facilities available?

There is Fullerton Health on campus, where all freshmen have to do a health check during matriculation. The prices are heavily subsidised as it is a school setting but should go early cause the queue can be quite long. There is also a polyclinic at Pioneer and the nearest hospital is Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.

### Do the school computers have Python pre-installed?

Generally yes, but for the most part you will be using your own computer for all of your work. You will only use the school computer for tests and lab, for which they would have already installed the necessary software and you will be guided in the lab assessment on its usage. It is your own responsibility to install the correct software for your courses.

Python, like most other software, can be installed in a myriad of ways. In my experience, the best way is to use [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) as you can download and switch between specific versions of Python depending on the needs of your project as different projects might have different dependencies. For other languages, please find a suitable package manager to help you with your installation. Here are some examples (might not work on Windows directly):

- [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (General purpose package manager)
