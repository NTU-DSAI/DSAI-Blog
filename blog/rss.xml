            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome one and all to the NTU DSAI Blog! This site was created to help current and future DSAI students by creating a single resource that everyone can refer to when it comes to anything DSAI or NTU.</p><p>This site is open source, meaning you as a student are free to contribute to the documentation as well as write blog posts documenting your experiences. this can range from Competitions that you have partaken in or new and interesting research in the field of Data Science and AI that you have come across. It can also be about events that have been organised at NTU that support or share the word about DSAI.</p><p>We hope that this site has been useful to you in ensuring that you have a great experience at NTU and that you could spend some time to help maintain the documentation to help future batches of DSAI students</p><p>Thank you all and stay safe!</p>]]></content:encoded>
